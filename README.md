# Weather App

## Overview
This is a React-based weather application that displays current weather, today's details, weekly forecasts, and demand mapping using a visually styled UI. Users can search by city, view real-time conditions, and navigate between feature-specific pages like Today's Weather and Check Demand.

## Prerequisites
Before running the app, ensure the following are installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repo)

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. The app should open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Key Configuration

This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API. To make it work:

1. Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a free account.
2. Get your API key from your dashboard.
3. Replace the API key placeholders (e.g., `'197f3dd796a4a34d3134600111570b71'`) in the code with your own key.

## Notes

- The app is optimized for a mobile view (375x667px).
- A static map image is used for the Check Demand page (no external map API required).
- You can customize city suggestions, map images, and weather icons as needed.
- below you can find details about the packages inatalled and the way of installing them
- the packages used are the default nodejs, npm and the api used is from open weather















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
